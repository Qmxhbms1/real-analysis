% Problem 3.1
\begin{problem}
  Prove that convergence of $\{s_n\}$ implies convergence of $\{|s_n|\}$.
  Is the converse true?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  By exercise 1.13. we have $||s_n| - |s|| < |s_n - s | < \epsilon$.
  The converse is clearly no true, consider $\{s_n\} = (-1)^n$.
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.2
\begin{problem}
  Calculate $\lim_{n\to\infty} (\sqrt{n^2 + n} - n)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \[\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt{n^2 + n} - n = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n^2 + n - n^2}{\sqrt{n^2 + n} + n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n}} + 1} = \frac{1}{2}.\]
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.3
\begin{problem}
  If $s_1 = \sqrt{2}$, and
  \[s_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{s_n}}  (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots),\]
  prove that $\{s_n\}$ converges, and that $s_n < 2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  It is clear that our sequence $\{s_n\}$ is monotonically increasing.
  We shall show inductively that this sequence is bounded by $2$, and hence convergent.

  Base case: $2 > \sqrt{2} = s_1$.

  Inductive step: Let $2 > s_n$ and let's consider $\sqrt{2 + s_n}$.
  By the inductive hypothesis we have $2 = \sqrt{2 + 2} > \sqrt{2 + s_n} = s_{n + 1}$.
  Hence $\{s_n\}$ is convergent, and $s_n < 2$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.16
\setcounter{problem}{15}
\begin{problem}
  Fix a positive number $\alpha$.
  Choose $x_1 > \sqrt{\alpha}$, and define $x_2, x_3, x_4, \ldots$, by the recursion formula
  \[x_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{\alpha}{x_n}).\]
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that $\{x_n\}$ decreases monotonically and that $\lim x_n = \sqrt{\alpha}$.
    \item Put $\epsilon_n = x_n - \sqrt{\alpha}$, and show that
      \[\epsilon_{n + 1} = \frac{\epsilon_n^2}{2x_n} < \frac{\epsilon_n^2}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}\]
      so that, setting $\beta = 2\sqrt{\alpha}$,
      \[\epsilon_n < \beta (\frac{\epsilon_1}{\beta})^{2n}  (n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots).\]
    \item This is a good algorithm for computing square roots, since the recursion formula is simple and the convergence is extremely rapid.
      For example, if $\alpha = 3$ and $x_1 = 2$, show that $\frac{\epsilon_1}{\beta} < \frac{1}{10}$ and that therefore
      \[\epsilon_5 < 4 \cdot 10^{-16},  \epsilon_6 < 4 \cdot 10^{-32}.\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Consider
      \[x_{n + 1} - x_n = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{\alpha}{x_n}) - x_n = \frac{x_n^2 + \alpha}{2x_n} - x_n = \frac{\alpha - x_n^2}{2x_n}\]
      We can inductively show that $x_n > \sqrt{\alpha}$ for all $n \in \N$.
      Hence our above equation is always negative and the sequence is monotonically decreasing.
      Since we know that it is bounded from below by $\sqrt{\alpha}$, by the Monotone convergence theorem we know that $\{x_n\}$ converges.
      Let $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = x$.
      Consider our relation
      \[x_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{\alpha}{x_n}).\]
      We can take the limit of both sides to get
      \[\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{n + 1} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{\alpha}{x_n}).\]
      Since $\lim x_n = \lim x_{n + 1}$, and using some properties of limits we get
      \[x = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{\alpha}{x}.\]
      Which with some simple algebra gets us
      \[x = \sqrt{\alpha}.\]
    \item We have the following
      \[\epsilon_{n + 1} = x_{n + 1} - \sqrt{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{\alpha}{x_n}) - \sqrt{\alpha} = \frac{x_n^2 + \alpha}{2x_n} - \sqrt{\alpha} = \frac{x_n^2 + \alpha - 2x_n\sqrt{\alpha}} = \frac{(x_n - \sqrt{\alpha})^2}{2x_n} = \frac{\epsilon_n^2}{2x_n} < \frac{\epsilon_n^2}{2\sqrt{\alpha}}.\]
    \item Simply put $\beta = 2\sqrt{3}$ and $\epsilon_1 = 2 - \sqrt{3}$.
      It is clear that $\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}} < \frac{1}{10}$.
      Hence $\epsilon_5 < 2\sqrt{3} \cdot 10^{-16} < 4 \cdot 10^{-16}.$
      Similarly we get $\epsilon_6 < 4 \cdot 10^{-32}.$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.17
\begin{problem}
  Fix $\alpha > 1$.
  Take $x_1 > \sqrt{\alpha}$, and define
  \[x_{n + 1} = \frac{\alpha = x_n}{1 + x_n} = x_n + \frac{\alpha - x_n^2}{1 + x_n}.\]
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that $x_1 > x_3 > x_5 > \ldots$.
    \item Prove that $x_2 < x_4 < x_6 < \ldots$.
    \item Prove that $\lim x_n = \sqrt{\alpha}$.
    \item Compare the rapidity of convergence of this process with the one described in Exercise 16.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Consider $x_{2n - 1} - x_{2n + 1}$.
      Using the recursion formula twice and some algebra we arrive at the following
      \[x_{2n - 1} - x_{2n + 1} = \frac{2(x_{2n - 1}^2 - \alpha)}{1 + 2x_{2n - 1} + \alpha}.\]
      We can easily see by induction that $x_{2n - 1} > \sqrt{\alpha}$ for all $n \in \N$.
      Combining this with our previous equation we can clearly see that
      \[x_{2n - 1} - x_{2n + 1} > 0,\]
      hence $x_1 > x_3 > x_5 > \ldots$.
    \item The same equation holds in this case except with $x_{2n}$ and $x_{2n - 2}$.
      We can again inductively show that $x_2n < \sqrt{\alpha}$ for all $n \in \N$.
      Thus we get $x_{2n} > x_{2n - 2}$.
    \item Consider the relation derived from our relations in a) and b), $x_{2n} = x_{2n + 2} + \frac{(1 + \alpha)x_{2n} + 2\alpha}{1 + 2x_{2n} + \alpha}$.
      It is clear that everything on the right side converges so we can take the limits of both sides and apply the properties of limits to get
      \[x = \frac{(1 + \alpha)x + 2\alpha}{1 + 2x + \alpha}\].
      Some simple algebra finally leads us to $x = \sqrt{\alpha}$, hence $\lim x_{2n} = \sqrt{\alpha}$
      We can completely analogously show that $\lim x_{2n - 1} = \sqrt{\alpha}$.
      Notice that $\lim x_{2n} - x_{2n - 1} = 0$, hence the sequence is Cauchy and thus convergent.
      Let $\lim x_n = x$.
      We know that every subsequence of $\{x_n\}$ converges to $x$ as well.
      Hence $\{x_{2n}\}$ must also converge to $x$.
      By the uniqueness of limit points we have $\lim x_{2n} = \sqrt{\alpha} = x$ and thus $x = \sqrt{\alpha}$.
    \item Let $\epsilon_n = x_n - \sqrt{\alpha}$.
      Some simple algebra shows us that $\epsilon_{2n} \sim (\frac{1 - sqrt{\alpha}}{1 + \sqrt{\alpha}})^2 \cdot \epsilon_{2n - 2}$.
      Similarly we get $\epsilon_{2n - 1} \sim (\frac{1 - sqrt{\alpha}}{1 + \sqrt{\alpha}})^2 \cdot \epsilon_{2n - 3}$.
      These converge linearly, while the sequence in exercise 16. converged quadratically.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.20
\setcounter{problem}{19}
\begin{problem}
  Suppose $\{p_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in a metric space $X$, and some subsequence $\{p_{n_i}\}$ converges to a point $p \in X$.
  Prove that the full sequence $\{p_n\}$ converges to $p$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $\{p_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in a metric space $X$ and let $\{p_{n_i}\}$ be a subsequence that converges to some $p \in X$.
  Pick an $\epsilon$-neighborhood around $p$.
  For a contradiction, assume $\{p_n\}$ does not converge to $p$, i.e., for any neighborhood of $p$ there are infinitely many points of $\{p_n\}$ outside of the neighborhood.
  Now pick a point of $\{p_{n}\}$ in our neighborhood such that $n > N$ (Where $N$ is the integer such that $n > N$ and $m > N$ imply $d(p_n, p_m) < \epsilon$).
  This is possible since most points of $\{p_{n_i}\}$ are in this neighborhood.
  Call this point $p_n$ and consider the neighborhood around $p_n$ with radius $\epsilon - d(p, p_n)$.
  Note that this is a subset of our $\epsilon$-neighborhood.
  Since $\{p_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, there are only finitely many points outside this $\epsilon$-neighborhood, a contradiciton.
\end{solution}

% Problem 3.21
\begin{problem}
  Prove the following analogue of Theorem 3.10(b): If $\{E_n\}$ is a sequence of closed nonempty and bounded sets in a complete metric splace $X$, if $E_{n+1} \subset E_n$, and if 
  \[\lim_{\n to \infty} diam E_n = 0.\]
  then $\bigcap_1^{\infty} E_n$ consists of exactly one point.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  We just need to show that $\bigcap E_n$ is nonempty, the rest is identical as in Theorem 3.10(b).

  First, we remove all duplicates, so that $E_{n + 1}$ is a proper subset of $E_n$.
  Note that this does not change the intersection in any way, nor does it change that $\lim_{n \to \infty} diam E_n = 0$.
  Now, for every $n$ pick a $p_n \in E_n$, such that $p_n \notin E_{n + 1}$ and $p_n \notin E_{n - 1}$.
  Let $G_n \subset E_n$ such that $G_n = \{p_n, p_{n + 1}, p_{n + 2}, \ldots\}$.
  Since $G_n \subset E_n$, clearly $diam G_n \le diam E_n$, hence $\lim diam G_n = 0$.
  Thus, $\{p_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, and since $X$ is a complete metric space, $\{p_n\}$ converges to some point $p$.
  Since every $E_n$ is closed, if $p \notin E_i$ for some $i \in \N$, then $p$ is not a limit point of $E_i$.
  However, since the sequence of points $\{p_n\}$ starting from $i$ converges to $p$, clearly $p$ is a limit point of $E_i$, a contradiction.
  Thus for every $n \in N$, $p \in E_n$, and finally $p \in \bigcup E_n$.
\end{solution}
